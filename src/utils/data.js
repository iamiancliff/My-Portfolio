This gave me a solid technical and professional foundation before moving into the specialization phase. I specialized in Full Stack Development (MERN stack), where I applied my skills in a capstone project called TabiaZetu â€” an EdTech classroom behavior management tool designed for teachers. The platform helps educators track student behavior, generate reports and analytics, and make data-driven decisions to foster positive student development. The project was completed as part of the program, but I continue improving it to make it more robust and impactful. I am set to officially graduate from the Power Learn Project in December 2025.",
